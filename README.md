### Advantages and Disadvantages of TDD

Some of the advantages of TDD is that the code would be easier to maintain the long run. Arranged code that is built for testing is often cleaner and more readable, as the content of what the test is trying to test. It also allows overall costs to be reduced because bugs and errors will be spotted earlier on in the development process and can be corrected sooner. Finally, following the TDD process will naturally produce better documentation for the code.

However, some downsides of TDD would being a slower development process, as you would need to write test cases for a lot of straight-forward features. When every feature regardless of certanity and complexity has to have a test written for it, it will eat into development time. Also, if the requirements of a project changes, not only will the production code need to be changed, but the tests that accompany them will need to change as well.
