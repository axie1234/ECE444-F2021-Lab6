### Advantages and Disadvantages of TDD

Some of the advantages of TDD is that the code would be easier to maintain the long run. Arranged code that is built for testing is often cleaner and more readable, as the content of what the test is trying to test would need to be explained. There may also be more efficient code as TDD puts a lot of emphasis on the process. It also allows overall costs to be reduced because bugs and errors will be spotted earlier on in the development process and can be corrected sooner. It would be a lot harder and expensive to fix code in the later stages of development. Finally, following the TDD process will naturally produce better documentation for the code. TDD forces development to be process-based, which means there would be more attention to how the code is written and therefore would need to be explained.

However, some downsides of TDD would being a slower development process, as you would need to write test cases for a lot of straight-forward features. When every feature regardless of certainty and complexity has to have a test written for it, it will eat into development time. Also, if the requirements of a project changes, not only will the production code need to be changed, but the tests that accompany them will need to change as well. Another thing would be that the tests donâ€™t really help you identify errors if the errors and wrong assumptions are built into the tests. If the tests are poorly designed, then doing TDD would only burn up more time.
